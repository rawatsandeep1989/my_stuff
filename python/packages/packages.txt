Packages are a way of structuring many packages and modules which helps in a well-organized hierarchy of data set, making the directories and modules easy to access.


Creating and Exploring Packages
step 1 : Frist we create a dir and give it a package name , preferably related to its operation

step 2 : then we put required functions and classes in it


step 3 : finally we create a __init__.py file inside the directory to let python know that is a package.
