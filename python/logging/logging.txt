Level of severity

The logger module has several levels of severity. We set the level of severity using this line of code:

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

These are the levels of severity:

The default logging level is warning, which implies that other messages are ignored. If you want to print debug or info log messages you have to change the logging level like so:
Type 	Description
DEBUG 	Information only for problem diagnostics
INFO 	The program is running as expected
WARNING 	Indicate something went wrong
ERROR 	The software will no longer be able to function
CRITICAL 	Very serious error

import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
logging.debug('Debug message')

Time in log

You can enable time for logging using this line of code:

logging.basicConfig(format='%(asctime)s %(message)s')

An example below:

import logging

logging.basicConfig(format='%(asctime)s %(message)s', level=logging.DEBUG)
logging.info('Logging app started')
logging.warning('An example logging message.')
logging.warning('Another log message')

Output:

2015-06-25 23:24:01,153 Logging app started
2015-06-25 23:24:01,153 An example message.
