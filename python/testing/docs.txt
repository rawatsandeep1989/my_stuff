Naming  rules here are : 

name of the testing file should be like,
test_<name of file for which this test is> 

name of the function which test a particular funtion should be like 
test_<name of function which it tests>




steps to follow:
1. create a module
e.g
calc.py



2. create a test class and import unittest inside it with naming convention as,
test_<name of class>
e.g
test_calc.py



3. Inside class we will create a class with any name and inherit unitest.TestCase
